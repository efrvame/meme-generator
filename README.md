# Meme generator

This app is built with `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `React`.
It allows you to generate random memes from the imgfilp API
and add top & bottom text to the image.

By building this I learned more about the following concepts in React:

-   Event listeners
-   State
-   Conditional rendering
-   Forms
-   Side effects
